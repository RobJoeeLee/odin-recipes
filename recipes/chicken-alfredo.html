                    <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 cups of low sodium chicken broth</li>
                    <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>8 oz. of fettuccine</li>

                    <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice.</li>
